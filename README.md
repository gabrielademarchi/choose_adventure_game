# Adventure game(s)

The first adventure game is a simple treasure hunt that made me practice the if/else statements of python. The story's path and the text snnipets were idealized in the Udemy's *100 days of code* course, by Dr. Angela Yu

The second adventure game (*main_alice*) is base on the book **Alice's Wonderland Adventure**, by Jim Razzi, from 1985. 
Hope you'll enjoy it as much as it took time to transcribe it lol!
